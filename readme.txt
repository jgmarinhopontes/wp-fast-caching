The fastest caching plugin for WordPress. FASTER than WP Super Cache, W3 Total Cache, WP Fastest Cache and many more...

== Description ==

**Fast AF caching! Optimize your website performance for the best page speed**

- Minifies HTML, JavaScript and CSS files
- Defers loading of JavaScript
- Compresses JPEG and PNG images
- Generates static HTML pages

Try it and see the results for yourself...

= Getting Started =

No complicated settings to deal with;

1. Deactivate/delete any current caching or minification plugins
2. Install fast caching
3. Activate fast caching
4. Log out
5. Refresh your home page TWICE

= "It broke my site, arrrrrrgh!" =

**Do the following steps, having your home page open in another browser. Or log out after each setting change if using the same browser. After each step refresh your home page TWICE**

1. Switch your site's theme to "Twenty Twenty" (or one of the other "Twenty..." Themes). If it then works, you have a moody theme
2. If still broken, go to the WordPress Plugins page and disable all Plugins (except fast caching, obviously). If fast caching starts to work, we have a plugin conflit
3. Reactivate each plugin one by one and refresh your home page each time time until it breaks
4. If _still_ broken after the above step, go to the Settings tab and try disabling JS optimisation for the Plugin which triggered an error in the previous step - this is done in the second section "Plugins JavaScript"
5. Finally, if no improvement has occurred, go to the Settings tab and experiment with toggling options in the first section "Core Settings"
6. If you have the time, it would help greatly if you can [log a support topic on the Support Page](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-roids) and tell me as much as you can about what happened

= How Fast Is It? =

In testing, fast caching was FASTER than:

- WP Super Cache
- W3 Total Cache
- WP Fastest Cache
- Comet Cache
- Autoptimize
- WP Speed of Light
- ...and many more!

= Where Can I Check Site Speed? =

Either of these two sites is good:

- [Pingdom](https://tools.pingdom.com)
- [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com)

= Software Requirements =

In addition to the [WordPress Requirements](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/), fast caching requires the following:

-	**`.htaccess` file to be writable**

	some security plugins disable this, so just turn this protection off for a minute during install/activation	
-	**PHP version greater than 5.6.0**

	It WILL throw errors on activation if not! No damage should occur though	
-	**PHP cURL extension enabled**

	Usually is by default on most decent hosts

== Installation ==

**NOTE:** fast caching requires the `.htaccess` file to have permissions set to 644 at time of activation. Some security plugins (quite rightly) change the permissions to disable editing. Please temporarily disable this functionality for a moment whilst activating fast caching.

The quickest and easiest way to install is via the `Plugins > Add New` feature within WordPress. But if you must, manual installation instructions follow...

1. Download and unzip the latest release zip file.
2. If you use the WordPress plugin uploader to install this plugin skip to step 4.
3. Upload the entire plugin directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
4. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress Administration.

	* Absolute paths to some assets such as images and fonts loaded via `@font-face` were sometimes incorrect
	* Some items were queued twice
	* Some items were not queued at all!
	
- **Fixed:** HTML minification was sometimes removing legitimate spaces, for example between two `<a>` tags
	
- **Fixed:** Caching function was sometimes running twice, adding unecessary overhead
	
- **Improved:** Some `.htaccess` rules
- **New:** Function checking in background `.htaccess` content is OK, with automatic/silent reboot of plugin if not
- **New:** Additional explanatory HTML `<-- comments -->` added to bottom of cache pages

= v1.3.6 =
